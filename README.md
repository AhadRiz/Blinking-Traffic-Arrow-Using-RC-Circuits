This Complex Engineering Problem involves the design and implementation of a low-cost analog
circuit to operate a blinking traffic arrow, utilizing only passive components and op-amps. The
circuit includes a full wave bridge rectifier to provide the DC power supply. An astable multivibrator
is employed to generate a 50% duty cycle square wave, which acts as the timing signal for the LED
blinking sequence. The LEDs are arranged in a pattern and connected to individual RC circuits,
which control the timing of each LED’s illumination. By carefully selecting resistor and capacitor
values, the LEDs blink in a sequential manner from the tail to the head of the arrow, creating a
moving arrow effect. This project demonstrates a cost-effective and implementable solution in a
laboratory setting for traffic management systems, highlighting the practical application of analog
circuit design techniques.
